<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    I was speaking to Lady Lywis-Smythe after the <em>incident</em>. We were situated in her 
    dining room, the late May sunlight streaming through the window, catching the
    motes of dust dancing in the sunbeam. Dear Aggy was speaking in hushed, urgent 
    tones about barristers, her eyes kept glancing to the the door, presumably 
    watching for the lingering eyes of the help.   
</p>
<p>
    I was not ungrateful for her wise words of wisdom, nor for her gracious hosting
    given the circumstances, but my eyes were transfixed on the objet d'art I 
    beheld.
</p>
<p>
    "Good Lord Aggy, what in heavens name is that!?" I could restrain myself no 
    longer. 
</p>
<p>
    "My dear Charles, stop changing the subject, please <em>listen to me</em>!"
</p>
    When she saw how captivated I had become, she finally revealed the secret I hand
    hungered for.
</p>
<p>
    "What has gotten into you? That is just a glass of water!" 
</p>
<p>
    Water.
</p>
<p>
    Agua vita.
</p>
<p>
    The stuff of life.
</p>
<p>
    My dear readers, you can be rest assured I put a halt to all other topics of
    conversation until that damned woman (and my dearest frien)d relinquished the recipe
    into my possession.

</p>
<p>
    Here I bequeath it to you.
</p>
<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Glass</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Optional: Ice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take your Lismore Nouveau Wine Glasses, ensuring you have removed 
        your leather driving gloves beforehand. You can dispose of these 
        and ensure that your fingerprints are marked on the glass, 
        setting up your alibi for later.
    </li>
    <li>Fill the glass halfway with water. I would always see Brock carry around 
        a bottle of Acqua di Cristallo Tributo a Modigliani. He was always so <strong>
        <em>vulgar</em></strong>
    </li>
    <li>At this point you may add ice. Do not dwell on the sensation of the 
        glass in your hand.
    </li>
</ol>
